# Skin-Cancer-Classification
Sorting pictures from the kaggle skin cancer dataset using PyTorch ML models.

Using convolutional layers and mini batch stochastic gradient descent, I was able to construct a model that has roughly 80% success rate of classifying malignant or benign tumors. I also performed an analysis of learning rates on two types of models, both full batch and mini batch models, finding which learning rates had the most success with each model.
